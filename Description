I started with creating a blueprint for CellBase,  which will be the cell/tile that can be clicked to spwan a new cell that has borders
Next, CellToSpawned blueprint was created, which contains the cell with boarders and the logic to change the visibility of the border when it collides with another cell with borders.
Worked on creating a 8 x 8 grid with the camera centered at mid poin of the grid
